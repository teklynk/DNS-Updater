DNS Updater

VBscript, ZoneEdit, DynDNS

Script checks to see if your dynamic IP address has changed by getting a response from icanhazip.com. It then reads a text file containing the last checked IP address. If current IP address is different, the script will update your DNS service (ZoneEdit, DollarDNS, DynDNS). Emails alert regardless, to let you know that the script ran and the status of the your IP, DNS.
